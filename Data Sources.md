# Data Sources

## The following publicly available datasets were used:

*	Plant Diseases Detection Dataset “ (Khan, 2023)
	    + This dataset includes annotated ground-level images from 30 classes of diseased and healthy plant species. Only Corn leaf blight, Corn Gray leaf spot, Corn rust leaf and Cherry leaf were used.

*	Millimeter-Level Plant Disease Detection from Aerial Photographs via Deep Learning and Crowdsourced Data (Wiesner-Hanks et al., 2019) 

  *Annotated ground level and aerial images of healthy and leaf blight afflicted corn leaves were used from this set. 

*	Banana Disease Detection Dataset (MMU (2023))

  *615 ground level images of banana leaves with fusarium wilt were used from this set

*	A Dataset of UAV Multispectral Images for Banana Fusarium Wilt Survey(Ye et al. (2022))

  *A large TIF (2.14GB) UAV image from this dataset was converted and augmented for use in this project. Bounding boxes for fusarium wilt afflicted banana trees had to be drawn on this large image based on the accompanying ground survey.

*	Banana Disease Recognition Dataset (Mafi et al. (2023))

  *The augmented folder of 602 ground-level healthy banana leaf images was used for this project. They did not include annotations. Bounding boxes were drawn manually. 

## The following dataset were purchased from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers’ Dataport:

*	“Cherry Tree Disease Detection Dataset” (Chaschatzis, Siniosoglou,. Ilias, et al. (2024))

  *This set included ground and hyperspectral aerial images of healthy cherry trees along with cherry trees infected with armillaria mellea (crown and root rot)

*	Peach Tree Disease Detection Dataset(Chaschatzis, Siniosoglou, et al. (2024))

  *This set included ground and hyperspectral aerial images of healthy peach trees and cherry trees with Anarsia lineatella (peach twig borer) or Grapholita molesta infestations. Only the healthy and Anarsia lineatella images were used.
